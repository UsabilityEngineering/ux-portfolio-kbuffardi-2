# Looping with Variations

I use [Reaper](https://reaper.fm/) Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) for recording and sequencing music. A common feature for DAWs is to enable simple sequencing of a synthesizer instrument by filling in a grid [Piano Roll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_roll) to program which notes should be played on which beat.

Piano Roll interfaces demonstrate an application of **"Match[ing] between system and the real world"**, a [usability guideline for using concepts in the real world](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) to help make user interfaces familiar and **learnable**. The piano roll interface originates from the design of player pianos, which used a roll of paper with punched notes that instructed the piano to play notes at a particular time. Here you can see a player piano roll ([courtesy of wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_piano)):
